# AR-music-visualizer-demo
This project is an AR demo of live music visualization and auto-generative 3D arts. I developed the above functions mainly to conduct the usibility test of a larger project - Arts under New York City. This project proposes AR music visualization of live music performances in NYC subway as a potential solution to public mental health. While there are other functions and features in the design, they are going to be present as user interface design and not included in this demo project. We only focus on the AR music visualization and the customization of it here.
